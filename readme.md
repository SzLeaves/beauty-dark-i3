* nm-applet ([NetworkManager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager))
* xfce4-power-manager (used to adjust backlight)
* dunst (used to system notice)
* picom (or compton)
* polybar

## Other Applications
* Gnome clocks (clock and timer)
* Gnome todo   (schedule)

## Location
`$HOME/.config/i3`  

## Unified Appearance (Qt and GTK)
**set environment variable in `/etc/profile`**  
`export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct`  
and run this command `qt5ct` in terminal  

If you want the qt4/qt5 appearance the same as gtk theme, set style as `gtk2`.   
You can also change the fonts setting.

## Key Setting
It is basically the same as i3wm normal configure.  
There are some new functional keys in this i3wmconfig:  
* `mod + c`          open clock application
* `mod + T`          color temperature adjust  
* `mod + F1`         open the pulseaudio to control volume
* `mod + F4`         open the bluetooth manager
* `mod + Shift + T`  cancel color temperature adjust  
* `mod + Shift + S`  open screenshot application
* `mod + o`          run `dunstctl` to close notification windows
* `mod + Shift + o`  run `dunstctl` to display history notification windows
